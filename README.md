Accessible E-mail Client

Kolumba is a very easy to use e-mail web client adapted to people with IDD so that they can use it at their working activity. 
 
The aim of Kolumba is to stimulate labour integration of people with IDD. In that context, it is essential to be able to use a mail client. Most existing ones are too complex, and therefore confusing, for people with IDD. Kolumba is especially used with Gmail.  It allows for the use of all three services used in the project:
Simplext: Any text received is translated to easy reading.
Text2Picto: It translates a text into pictograms. It is a technology to be used by people with lower literacy or reading comprehension skills.
Text2Speech: Changes written text to voice.
 
The Accessible email App is described at http://able-to-include.com/accessible-services/application/an-accessible-email/ and http://kolumba.taln.upf.edu/
